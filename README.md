### Minecraft Sound Extractor

Improved and overkill version of the minecraft sound extractor program 
on https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Sound_directory".

Usage:
 - Acquire this project's `main.py` file
 - Execute it in a terminal using `python3 main.py`
 - It will show you the installed Minecraft versions
 - For example: `1.18.json, 1.8.json, 1.14.json, 1.15.json, 1.12.json, 1.13.json, 1.10.json, pre-1.6.json, 1.13.1.json, 1.11.json, 1.16.json, 1.17.json, `
 - Type the one you want, for example: "1.18.json", hit enter and type the number of threads to use to extract the files. A single thread is sufficient, but the option is there.
